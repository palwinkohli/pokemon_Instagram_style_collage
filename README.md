Pokemon Instagram collage
In this exercise, we will build a photo collage using 5 images of pokemon.


Submission Instructions: You need to resize each pokemon 200X200 before using it. The final image should have size 430 X 430 px

(10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border = 430 px) along row and column.

After that you need to convert the final image into a single .csv file of the shape (rows x cols, 3). The CSV file should have a header "r,g,b" as column names.
